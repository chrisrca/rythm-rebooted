## Rythm Music Bot
Rythm was founded back in 2016 with the goal of creating a good way for online friends to listen to music together. It all came to an end last year, so I decided to recreate it. ðŸŽ¶

### Rythm HQ

Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with rythm, this was just a fun project I decided to take on. If you would like to join their discord server please do! https://discord.gg/rythm

This bot has both Spotify and Youtube integration so feel free to download it and host it for your discord server!

**IMPORTANT**: Because of the way this bot handles downloading audio and the queue it can only be used in one server!

This bot is also still a WIP and I have kinda abandoned it since I have moved on to other things, however it does allow playing songs and playlists from spotify and searching youtube for music via a url or text search.
